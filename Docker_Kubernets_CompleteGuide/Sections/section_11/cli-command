# Section 11: Multi-Containers Deployments to AWS

## This section we will learn how to deploy multi-containers into EBS (Elastic Beastalk) to run multi-containers in AWS.

Note: Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux and Multi-container Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux will be discontinuated until July 2022.
This approach use dockerrun.aws.json


## This Section will be using Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2 (Docker Running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2.)
Note: This approach use docker-compose.yml in the root of the project.

# To specify which docker file use to build our image we have to use flag -f when we are not using the default one like Dockerfile
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down
