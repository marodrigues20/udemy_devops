# By default docker containers cannot receive requests from my local network. However, it can reach outside world.
# One example of this, is when we are building a docker image when we have to install something where de command is 
# declared inside the Dockerfile.
# To enable incoming trafic to our docker container we have to specify when we gonna run our container.
# Docker Run with Port Mapping

$ docker run -p 8080:8080 <image id / image name>

# First 8080  -> Route incoming requests to this port on local host to 
# Second 8080 -> this port inside the container
